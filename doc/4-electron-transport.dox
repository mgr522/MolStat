\page page_conductance_histograms Electron Transport

This chapter deals with using MolStat to simulate and fit electron transport data; in most cases, conductance histograms. We begin with the theory behind electron transport, introduce conductance histograms, and then detail the implemented MolStat models.

\section sec_landauer Landauer Theory
All of the tools are based on the Landauer-B&uuml;ttiker-Imry theory of conductance through quantum systems \cite buttiker-6207, \cite imry-s306. Within this theory, the zero-temperature current is given as
\f[
I(V) = \frac{2e}{h} \int\limits_{E_\mathrm{F} - eV/2}^{E_\mathrm{F} + eV/2} \mathrm{d}E T(E),
\f]
where
   - \f$I\f$ is the current,
   - \f$V\f$ is the applied bias,
   - \f$E_\mathrm{F}\f$ is the Fermi energy of the system,
   - \f$E\f$ is the incident energy of the electron,
   - \f$T(E)\f$ is the transmission function.
   .
The transmission function depends on the specific model system used, and gives the aggregate transmission probability for an electron with energy \f$E\f$ to tunnel from one electrode to the other.

Several types of transport observables can be considered:
   -# Electric current, \f$I(V)\f$
   -# Zero-bias conductance
      \f[ \left. \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial V} I(V) \right) \right|_{V=0} = \frac{2e^2}{h} T(E_\mathrm{F}). \f]
   -# Differential conductance
      \f[ \frac{\partial}{\partial V} I(V) = \frac{2e^2}{h} \frac{1}{2} \left[ T(E_\mathrm{F} + eV/2) + T(E_\mathrm{F} - eV/2) \right] + \frac{2e}{h} \int\limits_{E_\mathrm{F} - eV/2}^{E_\mathrm{F} + eV/2} \mathrm{d}E \frac{\partial}{\partial V}T(E). \f]
	-# Static conductance
      \f[ \frac{I(V)}{V} = \frac{2e}{hV} \int\limits_{E_\mathrm{F} - eV/2}^{E_\mathrm{F} + eV/2} \mathrm{d}E T(E). \f]
   -# Zero-bias thermopower
      \f[ S = -\frac{\pi^2 k_\mathrm{B}^2 \bar{\mathcal{T}}}{3|e|} \left. \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}E} \left[ \ln\left( T(E) \right) \right] \right|_{E=E_\mathrm{F}}. \f]
   .
Various models (described below) can be used to calculate \f$T(E)\f$; from this transmission, all of the above conductances can be calculated.

\section sec_conductance_histograms Conductance Histograms
Conductance histograms are a common way for tabulating and analyzing experimental data on electron transport through nanometer-scaled systems (i.e., systems where quantum mechanical effects are inherent). Introductions to conductance histograms can be found in \cite krans-767, \cite xu-1221, \cite venkataraman-458, and \cite reuter-2243. In essence, the conductance through the system is measured many (thousands) of times, and the conductance data is binned into a histogram.

In MolStat, we assume that the conductance histogram reports the probability density function of the conductance observable \cite reuter-2243. As described in previous sections and in Refs.\ \cite reuter-2243 and \cite williams-5937, MolStat then regards the physical parameters in the transmission as random variables that determine the conductance's probability density function.

The two operations supported by MolStat are
-# Simulating conductance histograms using simple model systems (see \cite reuter-2243, \cite zhang-6254). This operation is described in \ref sec_simulate_electron_transport. Note that these model systems do not rely on first-principles electronic structure calculations; they are phenomenological. Other studies that construct histogram from such *ab initio* calculations have been reported in, for instance, \cite french-887.
-# Fit a conductance histogram (or, more accurately, a peak from a conductance histogram) to a specified functional form. This process is discussed in \ref sec_fit_electron_transport.

\section sec_simulate_electron_transport Simulating Electron Transport Properties
Simulating conductance histograms is accomplished using the MolStat simulator; see \ref sec_molstat_simulate for details. Herein we list the observables and models for conductance histograms. Each model facilitate calculation of \f$T(E)\f$ through various parameters.
