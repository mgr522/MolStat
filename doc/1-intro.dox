\mainpage Introduction

This software package provides tools for understanding and interpreting single-molecule behavior. Single-molecule experiments generally cannot determine, let alone control, the microscopic details of the system and, as such, are usually performed many times and interpreted statistically.

The key idea to understanding and interpreting these single-molecule measurements is that each measurement samples from a distribution of possible microscopic configurations. The observed data is thus probabilistic---not deterministic---and a combination of probability theory and statistical mechanics can be used to provide meaning to the data.

For a particular single-molecule process, there are several physical variables that determine the observed behavior. For example, \"molecular conductance\" experiments depend on the level alignment, the electrode-molecule couplings, and the applied bias. This software assumes that each of these parameters is a random variable with some distribution and that each experimental measurement samples from their collective distributions. The combination of conventional physical theories and probability theory then relates these underlying physical parameters to the observed data. Instead of measuring, for instance, *the* single-molecule conductance, the multitude of experiments collectively measures the probability density function of the conductance observable, which is more well-defined. The goal of this software package is to understand how these microscopic physical parameters relate to observables, in this statistical sense.

More information can be found throughout this manual.

\section intro_general_concepts General Concepts
There are two primary functions of this software package.
-# Simulate the probability density functions of experimental observables using known distributions on the underlying physical parameters. For the molecular conductance example, we put distributions around the level alignments and coupling strengths, sample from these distributions, and estimate the probability density function for the conductance observable.
-# Infer the statistics of the underlying physical parameters from the probability density function of the observable. This amounts to an inverse problem, which is, essentially, a (non-linear) fitting problem. Due to the mathematical effort required to obtain functional forms to fit against, the number of models is much more limited than for the simulator.

In both cases, the code was designed to be extensible and to accomodate new observables, new models, or both. This guide describes how to use the existing models and, also, how to add new ones.

\section sec_install Installation
MolStat requires
- a C++11 compiler. Most modern `g++` and `clang++` compilers are sufficient. Note for Mac users (OS 10.8 and older): the default `libstdc++` does not support C++11. When you run the `configure` script below, specify the compiler using, e.g., `CXX="g++ -stdlib=libc++"`. (The configure script automatically checks for `-std=c++11`.)
- (for some functionality) the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), which can be obtained at http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/. MolStat has been tested with version 1.16 of the GSL.
- (optional) python. Some tests use python.
.

\if userman
\note Information on extending MolStat to have new functionality is available in the full reference manual, which can be downloaded from \website.
\endif
\if fullref
Extending MolStat (see \ref extend_molstat) also requires
- the GNU autotools suite.
- (optional) `doxygen` and `pdflatex`, if you want to produce the documentation manuals directly from the code. PDF versions for the latest release will be available on the MolStat website, \website.

\subsection build_molstat Building MolStat

A configure script is provided to make installation straightforward. From the command-line, move to the top MolStat directory and use
\verbatim
./configure
\endverbatim
The command `configure --help` will display options for `configure`. By default, all modules are built into MolStat, which may require additional software packages. The following options disable this behavior.
- `--disable-simulator` -- Do not build the `molstat-simulator` program, any of its modules, or any of its tests.
- `--disable-fitter` -- Do not build the `molstat-fitter` program, any of its modules, or any of its tests. `molstat-fitter` requires the GSL.
- `--disable-module` -- Disable a particular module. Available modules are (replace `module` with the name listed below)
   - `transport-simulator` -- Simulating electron transport behavior, as described in \ref page_conductance_histograms.
   - `transport-fitter` -- Fitting electron transport behavior, as described in \ref page_conductance_histograms. This module requires the GSL.
.
Finally, should other packages be required (depending on the above options), they are specified with the following options to `configure`:
- `--with-gsl=<PATH>` -- Location of GSL headers and libraries. Ignored if the GSL is not required (per the other `configure` options).

After a successful configuration with `configure`, simply use
\verbatim
make
\endverbatim
to build the code.

\subsection build_extend_molstat Extending MolStat

\if userman
Details on how to extend MolStat can be found in the full reference manual, available at \website.
\endif

\if fullref
We encourage you to extend MolStat to have new functionality and hope that you would consider contributing your work into MolStat. The full MolStat code is available at \website and uses `git` to manage the repository. There are additional files in the repository that are not included in the distribution tarball (such as scripts for building the documentation).

Once you checkout the repository, first run autoconf to produce the `configure` script
\verbatim
autoreconf --install
\endverbatim
This must be done from MolStat's base directory. Then, follow the above instructions for configuring MolStat. One additional `configure` option that is not listed above is `--enable-documentation`, which produces scripts for building the documentation. This requires your system to have both `doxygen` and `pdflatex` in your path.

Building and testing the code is the same as described elsewhere. To build the documentation, do the following from the base MolStat directory.
\verbatim
cd doc
make
\endverbatim
The documentation is \b not automatically built from the top directory. Finally, to make a tarball of the code (for a release), make sure the documentation is up to date and run
\verbatim
make dist
\endverbatim
from the top MolStat directory.

Full information on extending MolStat can be found in \ref extend_molstat.
\endif

\subsection check_install Verifying the Installation
Several tests are also provided to verify a successful build, and can be run using
\verbatim
make check
\endverbatim

\note 
- The `fit-asymmetric-resonant.py` test can take several minutes to run.
- Some tests use python. They have been tested with version 2.7 and may not run in python 3. The configure script only checks for python 2.* and should omit the tests if only python 3.* is found.

\section changelog Version Changes
\subsection v_1_3_2 v.1.3.2 (Forthcoming)
- Added support for simulating two-dimensional conductance-displacement histograms (contributed by Mr. Ben Wu).

\subsection v_1_3_1 v.1.3.1 (February 2016)
- Added support for simulating thermopower and conductance-thermopower histograms.
- Provided better specification of units/dimensions for simulated observables.
- Bug fixes.

\subsection v1_3 v1.3 (May 2015)
- Added electron transport simulator and fitter models for background tunneling and destructive quantum interference effects.
- Reworked the build structure to allow out-of-place builds.
- Bug fixes.

\subsection v1_2 v1.2 (January 2015)
- Added the `molstat` namespace to identify components of MolStat.
- Reworked the simulator to allow more flexibility in input commands. Also added the idea of a \"composite\" simulator model for combining two (or more) models in the simulation.
- Implemented an independent histogram class that is not tied to the GSL (for making histograms in the simulator).
- Switched from the GSL random number generation tools in the simulator to those provided by C++11. The GSL is now unnecessary for compiling and linking the simulator.
- Tweaked the configure script to provide more options and flexibility.

\subsection v1_1 v1.1 (September 2014)
- Reworked the simulator and fitter codes so that they are more general and easier to extend. The codes are no longer specifically designed for electron transport applications.
- Expanded the discussion of how to run and extend MolStat in the documentation.

\subsection v1_0 v1.0 (July 2014)
- Initial release; general package framework and layout.
- Conductance histogram (single-molecule conductance) tools: simulator and fitter. The simulator produces zero-bias, static, or differential conductance histograms for a variety of model systems. The fitter can fit zero-bias conductance histogram peaks against three forms for resonant or nonresonant tunneling.
